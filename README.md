# sainsburys-mini-project
Repository for Sainsbury's data academy mini project

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to implement all of the techniques we have learned relating to Python. This will help us understand how they work in a real world setting. 

## Running

To run this program, ensure you have Python3 installed and download both on_demand.py and printfunc.py, ensure they are stored in the same directory. Run $ python3 on_demand.py in order to enter the program. 

## Avoiding a headache

If you want to avoid a headache, don't let people teach you how to use GitHub, or anything about source control, despite how advantageous it is. It has been haunting me for over a day now, and I'm thinking of getting a priest to free me from this curse. # Robs-Project

Day two, or is it? It feels so familiar, like I've been here before. I can't have. I must be tired.

Day three, the skies have greyed as do the hairs on my head. Memories thin like whisps of smoke from a long smothered fire. But one flame burns strong, prickling at the skin. Git, say the whipsers. I have no choice but to go toward it, the only light in my world. 

Day four? Did I skip some days? Perhaps my memory truly is a long gone skill of the past. Afterall, what use is a memory of the old world when this has born a new. I used to see skin, in all its shades, every day. Now all we, I, have are features formed of paper. They, too, fade almost as fast as the light in the eyes of the faces they captured. Birdsong is the only talk of the world now, foreign to me, alone. Though I am not sure the language of my peers would register any stronger were I to hear it outside of my dreams. All I have now are echoes of the past. 

Day...night...oh. Does it matter anymore? Screaming into the void, and worst of all, it refuses to scream back. I have decided to look for peace in religion. Who do you pray to when there is no voices in the dark? The Git Kata...


Will this torture ever end, cycles and circles, pain and hurt. Still I hold faith in The Git Kata

My faith has been strained over these last days, cold and alone. But in the distance I feel the ever growing warmth of the Kata.

I have become lost in the sauce of the kata. 



Heeeeelllllpppppp.
