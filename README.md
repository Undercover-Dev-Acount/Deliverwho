Repository for Sainsbury's data academy mini project

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to implement all of the techniques we have learned relating to Python. This will help us understand how they work in a real world setting. 

## Running

To run this program, ensure you have Python3 installed and download both on_demand.py and printfunc.py, ensure they are stored in the same directory. Run $ python3 on_demand.py in order to enter the program. 

## Avoiding a headache

If you want to avoid a headache, don't let people teach you how to use GitHub, or anything about source control, despite how advantageous it is. It has been haunting me for over a day now, and I'm thinking of getting a priest to free me from this curse.
